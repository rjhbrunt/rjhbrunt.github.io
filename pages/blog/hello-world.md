This is my first post on this site. I have two objectives with this blog. First,
I suck at writing, and I want to suck less. Second, I want to improve my ability
to communicate technical information. With that in mind, I am not sure how
useful this blog will be to others, but hopefully we can all learn something
together. Python is my jam, so I will start there and see where it takes me.
```python
import blog
print('Hello, World!')
```
