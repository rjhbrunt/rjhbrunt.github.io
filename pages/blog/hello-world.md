title: Hello World

I have two objectives with this blog. First, I suck at writing, and I want to
suck less. Second, I want to improve my ability to communicate technical
information. With that in mind, I am not sure how useful this blog will be to
others, but hopefully we can all learn something together. Python is my jam, so
I will start there and see where it takes me. Here goes nothing.

```python
import blog
print('Hello, World!')
```
